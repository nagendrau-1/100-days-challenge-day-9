Sabotage can disrupt internet connectivity of entire countries, 

Impacting banking, communication, and investigations

submarine cable vulnerabilities are a high-impact but often overlooked part of cybersecurity and geopolitics.

Here’s a clear breakdown of what “going deeper” really means (and how to frame it professionally for learning or posting):

Why Submarine Cables Matter

•	Carry 95%+ of global internet traffic

•	Support banking, cloud services, defense, and telecom

•	A single cable cut can affect multiple countries

Key Vulnerability Areas

1️ Physical Vulnerabilities

•	Shallow water exposure (near coasts)

•	Damage from:

 Ship anchors

Fishing trawlers

•	Very limited real-time physical monitoring

 Most cable cuts are accidental, but sabotage is possible.
 
2 Deliberate Sabotage & Espionage

•	State-sponsored threats:

•	Difficult to attribute attacks (plausible deniability)

 Example choke points:
 
•	Suez Canal

•	South China Sea

•	English Channel

3️ Network-Level Weaknesses

•	Poor encryption on older cables

•	Traffic interception at landing stations

•	BGP routing manipulation after cable disruption

 A cable cut isn’t just physical—it can trigger logical attacks.
 
4️ Landing Station Risks

•	Often located in:

o	Coastal cities

o	Politically unstable regions

•	Weak physical security = high-value target

•	Compromise here affects entire regions

Defensive & Mitigation Strategies

•	End-to-end encryption (modern standards)

•	Redundant cable paths

•	Satellite failover (limited but critical)

•	International monitoring & cooperation

Cybersecurity Insight (Big Picture)

Submarine cables blur the line between:

•	Cybersecurity

•	Critical infrastructure security

•	Geopolitics & national security

How cable cuts  
                                                                                                                                                                             How Submarine Cable Cuts Occur
                                                                                                                                                                             
1️ Ship Anchors (Most Common)

•	Large ships drop anchors in shallow waters

•	Anchor drags across the seabed

•	Cable gets snapped or crushed

•	Causes regional internet outages

 70% of cable faults happen this way
 
2️ Fishing Activities

•	Deep-sea fishing trawlers use heavy nets

•	Nets hook onto cables

•	Pulling force damages or breaks them

3 Natural Disasters

•	Earthquakes

•	Underwater landslides

•	Tsunamis

•	Volcanic activity

 Example: Taiwan earthquakes caused multiple simultaneous cable failures
 
4️ Deliberate Sabotage

•	State-sponsored or military operations

•	Divers, submarines, or unmanned underwater vehicles

•	Hard to detect and harder to attribute

 High geopolitical risk
 
5️ Aging Infrastructure

•	Older cables lose protective layers

•	Corrosion and material fatigue

•	Fail under normal seabed movement

6️ Attacks Near Landing Stations

•	Cables are shallow and exposed near shore

•	Easier to access than deep-sea sections

•	A single cut here can affect entire countries

Key Insight

Cutting a submarine cable doesn’t “kill the internet” —

it slows traffic, reroutes data, and increases attack surface (BGP hijacks, interception).

Geopolitical tensions

Submarine Cables & Geopolitical Tensions

1️ Strategic Control = Strategic Power

•	Countries hosting major cable landing stations gain leverage

•	Control over routing can influence:

o	Data flow

o	Surveillance capabilities

o	Economic stability

 Internet power today = cable geography
 
2️ Choke Points Become Flashpoints

Certain regions carry disproportionate traffic:

•	Red Sea / Suez Canal

•	Taiwan Strait

Any disruption here:

•	Affects multiple nations

•	Escalates diplomatic tensions

•	Triggers blame without proof

3️ Grey-Zone Operations

•	Cable cuts can be:

o	Accidental

o	Covert sabotage

o	Military signaling

•	Attribution is extremely difficult

 This ambiguity makes cables perfect for below-threshold conflict
 
4️ Espionage & Surveillance Concerns

•	Intelligence agencies may:

o	Tap cables

o	Monitor landing stations

•	Raises trust issues between allies

Result:

 Countries push for data sovereignty
               
 Regional cable projects increase
               
5 Economic & Political Pressure

•	Financial markets

•	Cloud services

•	Payment networks

All depend on uninterrupted cables

6️ Militarization of the Seabed

•	Naval forces now track:

o	Cable routes

o	Repair ships

•	Undersea infrastructure becomes a defense priority

 The ocean floor is the new strategic frontier
 
Big Picture Takeaway

Submarine cables transform the internet from a technical system into a geopolitical weapon, vulnerability, and bargaining chip.

Sabotage can disrupt internet connectivity of entire countries

 How Sabotage Can Disconnect Whole Countries
 
1️ Traffic Concentration Problem

•	Many countries rely on very few submarine cables

•	Small or developing nations may have 1–3 major links

•	Cutting just one or two critical cables can isolate them

2 Shallow-Water Vulnerability

•	Near shore, cables are:

o	Unburied or lightly protected

o	Easy to access with basic maritime equipment

•	Sabotage here is low-cost, high-impact

3️ Landing Station Choke Points

•	Landing stations aggregate all international traffic

•	Physical compromise or cable cut at this point:

o	Affects ISPs, banks, cloud services

o	Causes nationwide outages

 This is the single most critical weak spot
4️ Repair Takes Time

•	Specialized cable repair ships are limited

•	Repairs can take:

o	Days → Weeks

•	During this time:

o	Latency spikes

o	Bandwidth collapses

o	Services degrade or fail

5️ Cascading Digital Failures

Even partial disruption can trigger:

•	Payment system slowdowns

•	Cloud service outages

•	DNS resolution failures

•	BGP routing instability

  Impact goes far beyond “slow internet”
  
Real-World Impact Pattern

When sabotage or suspected sabotage occurs:

Impacting banking

How Submarine Cable Disruptions Impact Banking

1️ Payment Network Failures

Banks depend on real-time international connectivity for:

•	SWIFT messages

•	Card networks (Visa / Mastercard)

•	Cross-border UPI / remittance gateways

   Cable cuts cause:
   
•	Transaction delays

•	Failed international payments

•	Settlement backlogs

2️ ATM & Card Transaction Disruptions

•	Many ATMs authenticate transactions via centralized or overseas servers

•	Reduced bandwidth or high latency leads to:

o	Card declines

o	ATM “out of service” errors

o	POS failures in retail stores

3️ Core Banking & Cloud Dependency

•	Banks increasingly host:

o	Core banking apps

o	Fraud detection systems

o	Backup databases

o	in foreign or regional cloud data centers

4️ Market & Trading Impact

•	Stock exchanges require low-latency, continuous links

•	Even milliseconds matter for:

o	Forex trading

o	Derivatives

o	High-frequency trading

  cable cuts can force:
  
•	Trading halts

•	Price discovery delays

•	Increased volatility

5️ Security & Fraud Risks Increase

During connectivity instability:

•	Fraud monitoring systems may lag

•	Timeouts weaken real-time risk scoring

•	Attackers exploit chaos (social engineering, replay attempts)

 Outages create attack windows
 
6️ Regulatory & Trust Impact

•	SLA violations

•	Compliance reporting delays

•	Loss of customer confidence

  Central banks treat telecom outages as systemic financial risk
  
Big Insight

Modern banking doesn’t fail with empty vaults —

it fails when packets stop flowing.

Communication

 Impact on Communication When Cables Are Disrupted
 
1️ Internet & Mobile Networks

•	International internet traffic slows or drops

•	Mobile networks rely on backhaul links over submarine 

•	Effects:

o	Slow data

o	Call drops

o	Messaging delays (WhatsApp, Signal, email)

 Even local calls can fail if authentication servers are overseas

2️ Voice & Video Communication

•	VoIP services (Zoom, Teams, VoIP calls) need stable, low-latency links

•	Cable disruption causes:

o	Poor call quality

o	Video freezing

o	Session disconnects

 Real-time communication degrades first
 
3️ Emergency & Government Communication

•	Cross-border emergency coordination is affected

•	Diplomatic, defense, and aviation communications may:

o	Switch to backup links

o	Experience delays or reduced capacity

   This can impact disaster response and national security
   
4️ Media & Broadcasting

•	International news feeds

•	Live broadcasts

•	Content delivery networks (CDNs)

  Results:
  
•	Delayed news transmission

•	Blackouts of international channels

•	Reduced streaming quality

5️ Business & Corporate Communication

•	Cloud email servers

•	VPNs

•	International conference calls

  Enterprises may lose:
  
•	Remote access

•	Customer support channels

•	Global coordination ability

6️ Satellite Is Not a Full Replacement

•	Satellites handle only a small fraction of global traffic

•	Higher latency

•	Limited bandwidth

 Backup, not a substitute
 
Key Takeaway

When submarine cables are disrupted, communication doesn’t stop instantly —

it becomes slow, unreliable, and fragmented, which can paralyze societies.

Investigations

 How Submarine Cable Incidents Are Investigated
 
1️ Incident Detection

Investigations usually begin when:

•	ISPs detect sudden traffic drops

•	Network operators see BGP rerouting spikes

•	Countries report widespread latency or outages

  Network telemetry is the first alarm
     
2️ Fault Localization

Engineers narrow down the break using:

•	Optical signal loss measurements (OTDR)

•	Traffic path analysis

•	Comparison with known cable routes

This identifies the approximate break location (often within a few km)

3️ Maritime Correlation Analysis

Authorities then analyze:

•	Ship AIS data (vessel tracking)

•	Fishing activity logs

•	Anchor drop records

•	Weather and seismic data

 Key question:
 
Was any vessel present at the exact time and location?

4️ Physical Inspection & Repair

•	Specialized repair ships are dispatched

•	Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) inspect the cable

•	Investigators examine:

o	Clean cuts vs dragged damage

o	Tool marks

o	Cable deformation patterns

  This is slow, expensive, and weather-dependent
  
5️ Attribution Challenges

This is the hardest part:

•	Most damage looks similar (accident vs sabotage)

•	Oceans have no cameras

•	Attackers exploit plausible deniability

  Result:
  
•	Many cases remain officially “accidental”

•	Political conclusions may differ from technical findings

6️ Intelligence & Geopolitical Layer

For high-impact incidents:

•	Naval intelligence agencies get involved

•	Pattern analysis across multiple incidents

•	Comparison with regional tensions or military exercises

7️ Legal & Diplomatic Outcomes

Depending on findings:

•	Insurance claims

•	Diplomatic protests

•	Increased naval patrols

•	New cable protection agreements

   Very few cases reach clear legal accountability
   
Key Insight

Investigating cable sabotage is not like investigating a cyberattack —

it’s a hybrid of network forensics, maritime intelligence, and geopolitics.
